## ðŸ“£ Introduction

Although my career may be meager, I am proud that I have more experience than anyone else. The project mainly used Spring Boot to develop various customer service front-ends such as Sns Community and Submit. I like to challenge new environments. I feel the charm of the luff coding style, and since 2021, all development is raising skills so that users and administrators can develop in a comfortable environment at the same time.
